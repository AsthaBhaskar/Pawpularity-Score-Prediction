# Pawpularity-Score-Prediction


The dataset is taken from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/petfinder-pawpularity-score


## Problem Statement
Every day, thousands of stray animals throughout the world suffer on the streets or are put to death in shelters. There are many animals available for adoption. A shelter may become overcrowded if there are too many animals available and the facility's capacity is exceeded. To speed up adoptions and prevent congestion, websites for pet adoption must evaluate which characteristics or basic information about pets are most significant to potential pet adopters. Therefore, it would be crucial to understand what qualities a picture should have to become the most well-liked in order to successfully adopt abandoned animals. The importance of pawpularity (cuteness) ratings for stray animals cannot be overstated, yet the process is time- and labor-intensive. 



In response to these concerns, we have used a variety of data mining techniques, such as regression, decision trees, random forests, K Neighbors Regressor, and gradient boosting.


## Result
The objective is to identify which technique is most effective at predicting adoption rates or popularity. The metric used is RMSE. That came out to be 21.70 of K Neighbors Regressor,21.02 of Random Forest Regressor and for Gradient Boosting Regressor it was 21.19
